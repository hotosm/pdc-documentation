**SUMMARY**

If you can follow all the stages in this module, you already then you have successfully understood the use of ODK Collect as a tool for collecting data in the field. In addition, you have also successfully implemented the operation of the initial settings in ODK Collect and how to use ODK Collect to retrieve field data. Later, you will learn about other data collection tools in the field, OpenMapKit (OMK) application.

**Objectives:**

*   Explain OSMTracker as one of survey tools for recording tracks and photos

*   How to set up the OSMTracker for the first time

*   Learn how to use OSMTracker


### I. **What is OSMTracker?**

OSMTracker is an android application that allows us to record our survey data. Similar to GPS, OSMTracker is able to record waypoint and also track. If you want to learn more about GPS for field survey, you can see the **GPS Module**. What makes OSMTracker different with common GPS device is its capability to take pictures when you collect the survey data. With these images taken,  it will make your mapping more easier because you can track back what object you have been taken and take a look into your pictures for more detail. Waypoint and track that you have collected can be converted into .gpx file so you can open your survey data using JOSM or you can directly upload your data into OpenStreetMap. 

If you want to use OSMTracker you can download the application on your smartphone. Open your Google Playstore and search OSMTracker in search box.

### II. **OSMTracker Setting**

Before you can use the OSMTracker, there are few setting you have to do. Go to

![Setting](/en/images/01-OSM-Field-Surveyor-Guideliness/04-Menggunakan-Aplikasi-OSMTracker/0403_Tombol_settings.png) button on the top right corner and then select **Settings**.  

![Select Settings menu on OSMTracker](/en/images/01-OSM-Field-Surveyor-Guideliness/04-Menggunakan-Aplikasi-OSMTracker/0404_Memilih_menu_Settings_di_aplikasi_OSMTracker.png)
<p align="center"><i>Select Settings menu on OSMTracker</i></p>

On the settings page there are several things you have to look:

![Several configurations on Settings menu](/en/images/01-OSM-Field-Surveyor-Guideliness/04-Menggunakan-Aplikasi-OSMTracker/0405_Beberapa_pengaturan_pada_halaman_Settings.png)
<p align="center"><i>Several configurations on Settings menu</i></p>

1. GPS logging interval

    This section will set how often your OSMTracker record the track. If you set the number smaller, OSMTracker will record the track more often. The default value for this setting is 0, which means that OSMTracker will always record your track. This will affect your battery life. You can change the number according to your need, for example 2 second.  

2. External storage (SD) directory

    This section determine where you want to save all your survey data on your smartphone. By default, OSMTracker will create a new folder called “osmtracker” on your smartphone’s internal storage. If you don’t want to change this setting, you can ignore this section. 

3. One directory per track

    If you activate this feature, each track you save will create a new folder in your internal storage. 

4. Filename for named track

    This section will set the labelling of you survey data. By default, the labelling consists of track name, survey date, and survey time. You can ignore this setting if you don’t want to change it.

5. Screen always on

    If you activate this feature, you will let your smartphone always turn on when you use OSMTracker. When you using this setting, it will drain your smartphone’s battery fast. You can change it as you needed. 

6. Background map

    Use this setting to show the background map on your track. Activate this setting so you can see your survey track with map as it’s background. 

7. Map tile provider

    You can change your background map using this feature. 



After all the setting is done, then you are ready to use your OSMTracker. Always remember to activate your GPS setting on your smartphone, then you can open your OSMTracker. If you are using OSMTracker for the first time, your home page will be empty. Later, all your survey data will show up on your home page.



### III. **OSMTracker Basic Operation**
1. **Recording Survey Track**

    If you want to start your track recording, you can select the button **+** on your top right of your screen. You will see the Track Logger page. 

    ![Use button to start recording](/en/images/01-OSM-Field-Surveyor-Guideliness/04-Menggunakan-Aplikasi-OSMTracker/0406_Tombol_dengan_iconplus.png)
    <p align="center"><i>Use + button to start recording your track</i></p>

    Remember to always check your GPS accuracy. All feature on OSMTracker will not available if you are not receiving a good GPS signal. Try to get GPS accuracy as best as you can (below 10 meter) to prevent a mistake when recording your current position. You can see your GPS signal indicator on your top right corner of your screen (look at the picture). The signal bar color will change to green and become full when you receive a good signal. Make sure you are in a good position to receive signal. Locate yourself on the open field and make sure you are not under the roof or tree.

   1. Private

        Track will not shown up to the public. Trackpoints can be accessed on the time sequence using GPS API without time stamp. 

   2. Public

        Track will be shown to the public and available for download to the other user.

   3. Trackable

        Track will be shown to the public, but trackpoints still can be accessed by public GPS API. Other user can download your data but it will not connected with you.

   4. Identifiable

        Track will be shown to the public. Other user can download your data and can refer your OSM username. 


    For this option, you can choose Trackable or Public so another user can download your data.

**Objectives:**

* Using functions of tasking manager  for participatory mapping
* Operating tasking manager for mapping

As an alternative for open source mapping platform, OpenStreetMap allows everyone to do mapping anytime, anywhere. The problem is, what if you want to do mapping along with the other mapper on the same time? Tasking Manager allows you to divide an area of mapping so everyone can do mapping together. In this module, you will learn more detail about Tasking Manager and how to mapping using Tasking Manager.

## **I. What is Tasking Manager?**

### 1. **The Definition of Tasking Manager**

Tasking manager is a tool created specifically for participatory mapping. With Tasking Manager, you can simply do mapping together with the other on the same location, but with different area of mapping. Tasking manager can split the mapping area into separate grid or square. You can also use tasking manager to see your mapping progress, which are still need to map or which area is fully mapped. 

Now let’s think about this. Imagine if you want to create a mapping project in a specific area where you need to do the project together with another 20 mapper. If you’re not using tasking manager, there is a possibility of conflict between other mapper or between the data. With tasking manager, you can avoid the conflict and make the mapping project more fast and efficient.  

### 2. **The example of Tasking Manager**
Tasking manager used as a response when Haiyan typhoon occurred in the Philippines on November 8, 2013. Mapping area located in Tacloban city as one of the most severely damaged when the disaster happened. Within 24 hours after the tasking manager project was created. 10.000 buildings added or around 25% of the building amount in Tacloban City. This mapping project was carried out by 33 volunteers.

<p align="center"><i>Density of the building before and after mapping using Tasking Manager</i></p>

Tasking manager are also used in Indonesia as a response when disaster happened. One of the examples is when the earthquake and tsunami struck in the Sunda Strait in December 2018. Within a month, all affected areas were mapped by 60 volunteers.

   * **Project**
     
     On this part, you can see list of the tasking manager project created before.

   * **Mapping Difficulty**

     On this section, you can set your own mapping difficulty level of your project. There are 3 different levels: beginner, intermediate, and advance. If you want to see all the project, choose **All**.

   * **Organization**

     You can choose the creator of the project like American Red Cross, Missing Maps, HOTOSM, or HOT Indonesia. 

   * **Campaign**

     You can also find your tasking manager project based on certain campaign. For example, you can choose project for Malaria Elimination. 

     You can change the layout from Grid View to Map View. On the Grid View, you can see list of the project on grid/square layout. If you choose Map View, you can see the world map  with blue dots on the top of the map.

    ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0220_start_editor.png "image_tooltip")

   *   Tasking manager will automatically download OSM data. You can map the area using JOSM and satellite imagery based on information given by the project. If you want to learn more detail about how to mapping using JOSM, please go to the **Using JOSM Module**. Map all the objects inside the square/grid. 

     ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0221_Data_OSM_yang_telah_berhasil_di-download_melalui_tasking_manager.png "image_tooltip")
     <p align="center"><i>OSM data downloaded through tasking manager</i></p>

   *   Once you finished your mapping, don’t forget to upload your result periodically. Don’t forget to write down your comment when you upload the data. In the comment section, you can see default comment number similar to the tasking manager project. Please write your own comment after those numbers. 

   ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0222_Kolom_komentar_pada_saat_upload_data_dari_JOSM.png "image_tooltip")
  <p align="center"><i>Comment section when you upload your JOSM data</i></p>

   *   After you upload your data to OpenStreetMap, please go back to the tasking manager page. You can add your comment about changes happen. After finished mapping all objects, select **Mark as Completely Mapped.** But, if you haven’t finished your area, choose **Stop Mapping** and continue your work later or let the other contributor to finish the area.

### 5. **Things you need to know when you selected your area**

There are few things you need to know when you choose a tasking manager project. 

   *   **You only have 120 minutes to do your mapping**

    When you select one grid/square, you will own the grid/square for 120 minutes or 2 hours. Make sure you still in time to mapping your area and upload your data periodically. 

    ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0224_Pemberitahuan_batas_waktu_pengerjaan_tasking_manager.png "image_tooltip")
    <p align="center"><i>Notification of remaining time limit of your tasking manager’s grid</i></p>

   *   **Don’t forget to unlock your square/grid**
       
    After you have finished your mapping, don’t forget to click **Stop Mapping** if you haven’t finished your job. Click **Mark as Completely Mapped** once you very sure that you have finished your mapping area. 

    ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0225_Tombol_Stop_Mapping_digunakan_jika_grid_Anda_belum_selesai_dipetakan.png "image_tooltip")
    <p align="center"><i>You can use Stop Mapping button if you haven’t finished your grid</i></p>

   *   **Do not map area outside tasking area**
  
     ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0226_Area_yang_terarsir_tidak_boleh_Anda_petakan.png "image_tooltip")
     <p align="center"><i>You can’t do mapping on the shredded area</i></p>

    When your square/grid already shown in JOSM, you can see there is two different area on the map, the shaded area and unshaded area. You only allowed to map on the unshaded area. Please remind this things carefully to avoid data crash between another user. 

   *   **Special treatment for object located between the square boundary**
        
    Mostly when we mapping the area using tasking manager, you will see many objects located in between square boundary, like this:

   ![alt_text](/en/images/02-HOT-Tasking-Manager/02-Penggunaan-Tasking-Manager/0227_Objek_yang_terletak_di_perbatasan_grid_tasking_manager.png "image_tooltip")
    <p align="center"><i>Object located on the border of tasking manager grid</i></p>

 If you find those kind of object, you can draw the object slightly cross the boundary of your square. You need to draw the object like this especially for highway to give guidance for another user to continue your object. 


**SUMMARY**

Now you have learned the definition of tasking manager. Tasking manager is a tool that can be used to do the participatory and collaborative mapping with another user. When there is an area needed to be mapped quickly, tasking manager can help you to do so. Hopefully when you do mapping using tasking manager, your project will finish quicker and well organized.

**Objectives:**

*   Knowing to create an account in InAWARE
*   Knowing Add OpenStreetMap Data into InAWARE

The main goal of HOT-PDC InAWARE Mapping Project is to to complete and provide spatial open data for public so it can be used for any disaster management sector by National Government (BNPB) and Local Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) in InAWARE, a platform that made by Pacific Disaster Center (PDC), an institution from _University of Hawaii_. A complete explanation about InAWARE can be seen in PDC modules. This module will only explain about how OpenStreetMap data can be added and used into InAWARE.


### I. **Create and Access InAWARE Account**

InAWARE limit its access only to specific users such as National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), Local Disaster Management Agency (BPBD), humanitarian worker and disaster expert / practitioner. This policy is to maintain and ensure InAWARE critical information and content access still clear and without any intervention during disaster management activities. You can send a request to create InAWARE account with these steps:

*   Access InAWARE at **inaware.bnpb.go.id/**
*   Click **Request InAWARE Access** in **_login_** page.

The process would take about 24 hours before your request being approved. It also depends on BNPB as approval of the request. When you account has been made, it will be sent to you by _e-mail_.

*    Please **_login_** into system

### **II. Adding _OpenStreetMap_ Data into InAWARE**

After you know about InAWARE and the steps to create an account, you will learn about how to add your field survey data that have been uploaded on OpenStreetMap into InAWARE. Data spatial format which can be used in InAWARE is **_GeoJSON._** You can see **Converting Shapefile to GeoJSON** module. These are steps how to add OpenStreetMap data into  InAWARE:

*   Please click **_Layers _**menu in InAWARE
*   Click **_Edit_** and select **_Add Layer_**

<p align="center"><i>Add OpenStreetMap data as a New Layer</i></p>

*   Select **_File_** and click **_Please Choose the File_**
*   Search and find your OpenStreetMap Data that has been converted into GeoJSON format
*   Your OSM data layer will appear in InAWARE and placed into **_KML & External Layers_** folderwith name **_GeoJSON_ _Feature_**

*   You will see information of each feature / object from your OpenStreetMap data. You can select and click on the feature that you want to know its information and choose **_info _**option.

### **SUMMARY**

Congratulations! You have understand about InAWARE and how to add you field survey data into it. For more advanced analysis, you can overlay others layer with your OpenStreetMap data in InAWARE. You can look at PDC modules that provided by _Pacific Disaster Center_ (PDC) for more information about InAWARE.

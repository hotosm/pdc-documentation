      <description>Objectives:
 Understand how to download JOSM installation file Able to install JOSM Able to change JOSM settings Understand JOSM interface  Java OpenStreetMap (JOSM) is a OpenStreetMap desktop-based editor. JOSM allows you to edit the mapping data in offline mode for some time, so you don’t always need to connect to the internet. It will certainly make it easier for everyone who works within limited internet connections. You only need an internet connection when downloading data from OpenStreetMap and when uploading data to OpenStreetMap server.</description>

      <description>Objectives:
 To be able to do plugin installation to input data in JOSM To be able to operate to-do list plugin in JOSM to input the data  After conducting a survey using the OpenMapKit (OMK) application, the next step you need to do is to input survey data as points in OpenStreetMap using JOSM. To make it easier for you to do that, you need to install JOSM plugin named Todo list plugin.</description>

      <description>Objectives:
 To be able to activate data filtering mode on JOSM To be able to operate a data filtering tool on JOSM  JOSM has many tools that can be used by the user to make mapping things easier, like a filter tool. Filter tool is an additional tool that allows you to select or shown only certain objects on JOSM based on key and value on OpenStreetMap. With these tools, you can edit or check specific data on OSM.</description>

      <description>Objectives:
 To be able to install plugin for drawing buildings To be able to use JOSM plugin to draw buildings  When you map using JOSM without conducting field survey, the information mapped on OSM will be very limited since you only use satellite imagery as reference. One of the objects that can be mapped using satellite imagery as reference is building. However, you won’t be able to figure out the specific function of the mapped buildings unless the building has a unique shape such as an L-shaped or a U-shaped school building.</description>

      <description>Objectives:
 Participants can explain what is data conflict on OpenStreetMap Participants knowing about types of conflict in JOSM Participants can fix data conflicts using JOSM Participants know to avoid data conflict in JOSM  When you are uploading your changes in JSOM, some contributors might also do editing in your area. This might occur data conflict in your uploading process. Therefore, in this module, you will learn about data conflict in OpenStreetMap, types of conflict, and how to fix it using JOSM.</description>
